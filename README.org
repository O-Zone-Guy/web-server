This website serves as my online portfolio and a way to maintain my documentation.

* Documentation
  A collection of pages that document what I know about the relevant topics. Consider a blog that also serves as documentation and I expect no one to regularly check and read.

  - [ ] Make list as links
  - [ ] Create base files for each documentation 'site'
